# Relationship API Demo

This example mirrors the `examples/web` bootstrap but focuses on showcasing every relationship type supported by `go-crud` and the router metadata extractor. It runs entirely through JSON APIs and the autogenerated OpenAPI explorer.

## Features

- `PublishingHouse` with has-one `Headquarters`, has-many `Authors` and `Books`
- `Author` with has-one `AuthorProfile`, has-many `Book`
- `Book` with belongs-to `Author`/`PublishingHouse`, has-many `Chapter`, many-to-many `Tag`
- Automatic OpenAPI document at `/meta/docs/` plus `/openapi.{json,yaml}`
- Seed data for experimenting with `include=` queries (e.g. `GET /api/authors?include=profile,books.tags`)

## Running

```bash
# from the repository root
cd examples/relationships
go run .
```

> **Note:** the example uses separate Go module metadata. Run `go mod tidy` once you have network access to populate `go.sum` and download dependencies.
